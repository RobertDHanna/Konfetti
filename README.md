# Konfetti

A Chrome Extension that creates a delightful burst of confetti everytime you click.

## Installation

Run Yarn to install the dependencies.

```bash
yarn
```

Build the project.

```bash
yarn run build
```

or

```bash
yarn run build-prod
```

After building, a `main.js` file will be populated in the `dist/` folder.

## Load the extension locally

To test the extension locally open up Chrome and type `chrome://extensions` in the
search bar.

Click on `Load unpacked` and navigate to the `dist/` folder in the file explorer and confirm.

The extension should work in a new tab(s).

Note: Make sure `Developer mode` has been enabled on the `chrome://extensions` page.
